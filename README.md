# E2E CP Spring Boot application template

## Purpose

The purpose of this template is to speed up the creation of new E2E Spring applications within HMCTS
and help keep the same standards across multiple teams. If you need to create a new app, you can
simply use this one as a starting point and build on top of it.

## What's inside

The template is a working application with a minimal setup. It contains:
* application skeleton
* cucumber features and tests runner
* common plugins and libraries
* [HMCTS Java plugin](https://github.com/hmcts/gradle-java-plugin)
* docker setup
* code quality tools already set up
* MIT license and contribution information

The application exposes health endpoint (http://localhost:4550/health).

## Plugins

The template contains the following plugins:

* HMCTS Java plugin

  Applies code analysis tools with HMCTS default settings. See the [project repository](https://github.com/hmcts/gradle-java-plugin) for details.

  Analysis tools include:

  * checkstyle

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html

    Performs code style checks on Java source files using Checkstyle and generates reports from these checks.
    The checks are included in gradle's *check* task (you can run them by executing `./gradlew check` command).

  * org.owasp.dependencycheck

    https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-gradle/index.html

    Provides monitoring of the project's dependent libraries and creating a report
    of known vulnerable components that are included in the build. To run it
    execute `gradle dependencyCheck` command.

* jacoco

  https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html

  Provides code coverage metrics for Java code via integration with JaCoCo.
  You can create the report by running the following command:

  ```bash
    ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
  ```

  The report will be created in build/reports subdirectory in your project directory.

* io.spring.dependency-management

  https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin

  Provides Maven-like dependency management. Allows you to declare dependency management
  using `dependency 'groupId:artifactId:version'`
  or `dependency group:'group', name:'name', version:version'`.

* org.springframework.boot

  http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/

  Reduces the amount of work needed to create a Spring application


* com.github.ben-manes.versions

  https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin

  Provides a task to determine which dependencies have updates. Usage:

  ```bash
    ./gradlew dependencyUpdates -Drevision=release
  ```

## Building and deploying the application

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew clean build
```

### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew assemble
```

Note: Docker Compose V2 is highly recommended for building and running the application.
In the Compose V2 old `docker-compose` command is replaced with `docker compose`.

Create docker image and run docker compose:

```bash
  docker compose up --build
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `4550` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:4550/health
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
  {"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":249644974080,"free":137188298752,"threshold":10485760}}
```
